Kubernetes:

With Kubernetes ingress, you can easily expose your services to the internet while
maintaining granular control over who has access to them.



Kubernetes is a platform that helps you run your containerized applications on a massive scale.
 A key aspect of this is ensuring that different parts of your apps can easily communicate.
  Kubernetes does this by using Kubernetes Services.
 These Services allow smooth communication between components within the cluster
  and between the cluster and the outside world.




 Think of it this way: if you need more replicas of your app because of an increase
  in incoming traffic (more demand), Kubernetes will spin up some new Pods to handle it.
   If a Pod fails for some reason, no worries - Kubernetes will quickly create a new one to replace it.
    If you want to update your app, Kubernetes can destroy old Pods and create new ones with the updated code.
 So, the set of Pods running at one moment could be totally different from the set running a moment later.
